# FEATURE SELECTION
# Goal: leave this section with a dataframe with the features to be used to build your model.

# Are there new features you could create based on existing features that might be helpful?

# You could use feature selection techniques to see if there are any that are not adding value to the model.

# feature_selection.py: to run whatever functions need to be run to end with a dataframe that contains the features that will be used to model the data.
